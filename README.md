# RANDOMIZER FOR MIRRORLIST PACNEW


This looks if there is a new file mirrorlist.pacnew, if so, it generates a random list of servers but with always including Swiss and Worldwide servers.

This ensures that the mirrorlist is uptodate.

Will run on a *daily* basis with crontab (TODO and TOCONFIRM)
